							Have you ever looked at those blue words and blue underlines? Yeah, same.
							It's just a pain to see them in Word documents. How about in websites
							made of HTML and CSS? Can we make them more gorgeous and clickbait-y?
						</div>
						
						<div>
							Well, you can definitely style your links in CSS. However, you have to
							specify a pseudoclass for this, which is <span>:link</span>. This is
							placed adjacent to the anchor tag, like <span>a:link</span>. This will
							only work for unvisited links. If you want to modify visited links too,
							you can also add <span>a:visited</span>.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							After specifying the pseudoclasses, set the <span>text-decoration</span>
							property under both unvisited and visited links to none to remove the 
							unwanted underline. Next, change the font color using the <span>color
							</span>property to change the blue color of the text.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							Taking these a step further, you can add the pseudoclasses <span>:active
							</span> and <span>:hover</span> for interactions upon clicking and
							hovering, respectively. Adding a transition time will make those
							changes smooth.

						<div>
							In this particular section, I will only discuss five of the six different
							values of the position property. These are static, absolute, relative,
							fixed, and sticky.
						</div>
						
						<div>						
							<span>position: static;</span> — the default setting for elements. 
							The flow will behave as	ordered in the source code. Positional 
							properties will be disregarded for this certain type.
						</div>
						
						<div>						
							<span>position: absolute;</span> — removes the element from the flow of
							the document. It is always relative to a parent whose position is non-static.
							If there are none, it will automatically be positioned relative to the document.
						</div>
						
						<div>						
							<span>position: relative;</span> — modifies an element's position relative
							to its original location. Positional properties will work and nudge the element.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<span>position: fixed;</span> — functions like absolute positioning. It is always
							relative to the document and stays on-screen even with the movement of
							scrollbars.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							<span>position: sticky;</span> — will initially function like relative positioning
							but will function like fixed positioning upon scrolling to a certain extent. See
							the header and the footer of this site as reference.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							With these, you can either do a trial-and-error to see what type works best
							for your element or idealize before executing your plan.

					<div class="head"> Not Hover Over Hovering? </div>

						<div>
							Have you noticed that after letting your mouse cursor touch
							an element to experience the hover effect, the effect abruptly
							wears off? It's kind of sudden. However, if you want to 
							make it smoother by adding some transition time before returning
							to its original style, then this tip is for you!
						</div>
						
						<div>
							A negation pseudoclass can be used to make this more smooth. 
							This is declared by using <span>:not</span>. However, you also
							need to specify the class which is supposed to be negated. For
							instance, if you want to add an animation after hovering, you
							can use <span>:not(:hover)</span>.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							This can also be used to exclude certain classes. For instance,
							if you want to exclude <span>div#ter</span>, you can use <span>
							:not(#ter)</span>.

					<div class="head"> Align-meant </div>
					
					<div class="body">
						<div>
							Horizontally aligning a text or an image is really easy. Inserting
							the <span>text-align</span> property will solve it. However, 
							vertically aligning an element will be a challenge if you don't know
							how to approach it.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							A common misconception to vertically aligning elements is using
							the <span>vertical-align</span> property; similarly, using the 
							text-align property on everything doesn't quite solve your problem
							on alignment and yield an intended result.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							There are two approaches when it comes to aligning items both
							vertically and horizontally. The solution is actually changing 
							the <span>display</span> property instead of the default block
							value. You can change it to <span>display: flex;</span> or
							<span>display: grid;</span> to gain the ability of aligning
							properly and simultaneously.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							When using <span>display: flex;</span>, the alignment will
							depend on the <span>flex-direction</span> property. By default,
							this is set to row value. With the default setting, the <span>
							justify-content</span> and the <span>align-items</span> property
							will align elements horizontally and vertically, respectively.
							However, when this is set to column value, the properties will
							align elements inversely to the row value. These will apply even
							with the row-reverse and column-reverse values.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							When using <span>display: grid;</span>, there are two properties
							which will align the elements decently. These are the <span> 
							justify-items</span> property and the <span>align-items</span>
							property. Think of the first as aligning on the x-axis, while the
							second as aligning on the y-axis.

						<div>
							Remember the <span>position: sticky;</span> discussed earlier?
							How about <span>position: fixed;</span>? These work similarly,
							the only difference is that the former can appear later, whereas
							the latter always appears on-screen.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							You can choose to select <span>position: sticky;</span> if you
							want headers that stay on-screen to hint the audience of your
							site about the topic and to not get lost in reading. You can also
							choose this property like the header designed in this website to 
							occupy a space without obstructing other elements, since it
							is designed to be like relative positioning until a certain
							extent where it imitates fixed positioning. Do note, however,
							that once the parent is gone, so is the child whose position
							is sticky. The only exception is if the parent is the <span>
							body</span>.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							Selecting <span>position: fixed;</span> is best for advertisements
							on site and retaining any elements on-screen. This has a tendency
							to block other elements.

							Simply putting <span> input </span> tags on a contact section

						</div>
						
						<div>
							You may want to add the <span>padding</span> and the <span>margin
							</span>properties on those input whose type involves text. You
							can select certain types of input by declaring <span>input[type]
							</span> in the site's CSS.
						</div>
						
						<div>
							Customizing the <span>submit</span> button? Bring it on! You can
							modify the word inside a submit button by typing <span>value="SEND"
							</span> as an example. Add some hover and active effects and you've
							got yourself a gorgeous button.

							With all these inspirations, you'll start thinking, "Hey,

							recommend you don't. Just stick with your ideas and
							focus on styling these. Maybe you'll be better off
							doing this rather than starting from square one.

							Remember: <span>"Believe in all your heart."</span> Put your best

							Have fun in making your project!
